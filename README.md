## Technology Stack

### - Django
A high-level Python web framework used for building robust and scalable RESTful APIs and managing server-side logic.

### - PostgreSQL
A powerful open-source relational database system used to store structured application data, like users, listings, and bookings.

### - GraphQL (optional)
An API query language used for more efficient data retrieval, enabling clients to request only the data they need.

### - Docker
Containerization tool used to package the application and its dependencies into isolated environments for consistent development and deployment.

### - GitHub Actions
A CI/CD automation tool used to automate testing, building, and deployment processes on every push or pull request.

### - React (optional)
A frontend JavaScript library used to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

## Database Design

### **1. Users**
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `name`
- `email`
- `password_hash`
- `role` (guest/host)
- **Relation**: Can book properties and/or host multiple properties.

### **2. Properties**
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `title`
- `description`
- `location`
- `host_id` (Foreign Key to Users)
- **Relation**: Belongs to a user (host), has many bookings and reviews.

### **3. Bookings**
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `user_id` (Foreign Key)
- `property_id` (Foreign Key)
- `start_date`
- `end_date`
- **Relation**: A booking links a user with a property.

### **4. Reviews**
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `user_id` (Foreign Key)
- `property_id` (Foreign Key)
- `rating`
- `comment`
- **Relation**: A user can review a property after booking.

### **5. Payments**
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `user_id` (Foreign Key)
- `booking_id` (Foreign Key)
- `amount`
- `status`
- **Relation**: Linked to a booking and user who made the payment.

## Feature Breakdown

### - User Management
Handles user registration, login, role-based access (guest/host), and profile management. Ensures only authorized users access specific features.

### - Property Management
Allows hosts to create, update, and delete property listings. Includes photo uploads, pricing, availability, and description details.

### - Booking System
Guests can search for listings, view availability, and book properties. Hosts can view and manage their bookings.

### - Payment Integration
Secure payment processing for bookings, including transaction history and status updates.

### - Reviews and Ratings
Users can leave reviews and rate properties they have booked, helping future users make informed decisions.

### - Search and Filter
Search properties based on location, date, price, and amenities for better user experience.

## API Security

### - Authentication
JWT-based authentication ensures that only registered users can access protected endpoints.

### - Authorization
Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts access to specific resources (e.g., only hosts can list properties).

### - Rate Limiting
Prevents abuse by limiting the number of API requests a user can make in a given time frame.

### - Data Validation & Sanitization
Ensures inputs are valid and prevents injection attacks.

### - HTTPS & Encryption
All data is transmitted securely using HTTPS, and sensitive data like passwords are encrypted before storage.

**Why it's important:**
- **Protecting User Data:** Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive user information.
- **Securing Payments:** Ensures transactions are safe and compliant.
- **Maintaining Trust:** Users expect reliable and secure platforms for financial transactions and data sharing.

## CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is a set of practices that automates the process of building, testing, and deploying applications. It ensures quicker, safer, and more reliable software delivery.

### Tools Used:
- **GitHub Actions:** Automates testing and deployment workflows.
- **Docker:** Ensures consistency across development and production environments.
- **Heroku/Vercel/Render:** Platforms that can be used for deployment of frontend/backend services.

### Why CI/CD Matters:
- **Faster Releases:** Automates repetitive tasks, allowing developers to focus on coding.
- **Quality Assurance:** Catches bugs early with automated testing.
- **Consistency:** Reduces human error and ensures the same environment across stages.
